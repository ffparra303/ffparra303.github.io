**Watch Your Step: The Economic and Behavioral Responses of Rural Households to Landmines During Conflict (Job Market Paper)**<br>
(with [Sakina Shibuya](https://sakinashibuya.org))[[Paper](https://ffparra303.github.io/papers/FelipeParra_JMP.pdf)]

<p style="font-size: 85%; width=80%"><b>Abstract:</b> Antipersonnel landmines, though intended to target combatants, disproportionately impact civilians, disrupting economic activity and altering household decision-making processes. This paper examines how landmine-related events affect rural households' livelihoods, shortly after these incidents occur. Using detailed spatial data on both landmine events and household locations, we identify incidents occurring near households' residences. Our findings show that households reduce risky activities, such as agricultural labor and healthcare-seeking, following recent landmine events. Individuals exposed to landmines near their residence and shortly before the planting season are 16% less likely to work in long-term agricultural jobs on other households' farms and 12% less likely to work on their own fields. These households are also more likely to hire external workers, likely substituting their own labor. Furthermore, exposed adults are less inclined to seek formal medical care for preventative reasons. However, these behavioral adjustments are conditioned by households liquidity constraints. Wealthier households reduce agricultural labor, whereas liquidity-constrained households engage in agricultural day labor following landmine exposure, likely to compensate for income losses from reduced work in other agricultural jobs and non-agricultural occupations. This study sheds light on the unequal risk-bearing capacities of rural households in conflict zones.</p>


**When Protection Fails: Effects of Military Bases on Sexual Violence in Colombia**<br>
(with [Sakina Shibuya](https://sakinashibuya.org))[[Paper](https://sakinashibuya.org/files/JMP_SakinaShibuya.pdf)]

<p style="font-size: 85%; width=80%"><b>Abstract:</b> Sexual violence committed by soldiers are ubiquitous across the world. This paper investigates the impact of military base presence on sexual violence, fertility, and child support disputes in Colombia, a nation with a recent experience of large-scale growth in military base presence. Using a novel dataset constructed from diverse sources, we track military base locations across Colombian municipalities from 1998 to 2016. Employing an event-study approach, we identify the causal effects of military bases on host communities. Our findings reveal that the presence of military bases significantly increases sexual violence, with a 72% rise in registered cases over the course of 16 years after the introduction of military base. Despite this increase in sexual violence, we find no significant changes in fertility or child support disputes. These results are not driven by changes in population or security conditions. This study advances the literature on conflict-related sexual violence and the broader consequences of military base presence on local populations.</p>
