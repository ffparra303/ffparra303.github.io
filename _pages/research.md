**Watch Your Step: The Economic and Behavioral Responses of Rural Households to Landmines During Conflict (Job Market Paper)**<br>
(with [Sakina Shibuya](https://sakinashibuya.org))[[Paper](https://ffparra303.github.io/papers/JMP_FelipeParra.pdf)]

<p style="font-size: 85%; width=80%"><b>Abstract:</b> Antipersonnel landmines, though intended to target combatants, disproportionately impact civilians, disrupting economic activity and altering household decision-making processes. This paper examines how rural households in Colombia adjust their labor market decisions and healthcare-seeking behavior in response to recent and nearby landmine events, using detailed spatial data on landmine events combined with longitudinal household survey data. Our findings show that individuals engage less in risky labor activities following recent landmine events, but these responses are heavily influenced by liquidity constraints. Specifically, liquidity-unconstrained individuals are 28% less likely to work in occupations other than agricultural day labor, particularly in agriculture, and 12% less likely to spend time on agricultural tasks in their own fields. These households hire additional agricultural workers after landmine exposure, substituting external labor for their own. In contrast, liquidity-constrained individuals are 45% more likely to engage in agricultural day labor to compensate for income losses stemming from reduced non-agricultural employment. Moreover, landmine events deter both adults and children from seeking formal preventative medical care. This study highlights the differences in responses between liquidity-constrained and unconstrained individuals to shifts in perceived security during conflict.</p>


**When Protection Fails: Effects of Military Bases on Sexual Violence in Colombia**<br>
(with [Sakina Shibuya](https://sakinashibuya.org))[*draft coming soon*]

<p style="font-size: 85%; width=80%"><b>Abstract:</b> Sexual violence committed by state soldiers are ubiquitous across the world. This paper investigates the impact of military base presence on sexual violence, fertility, and child support disputes in Colombia, a nation with a recent experience of large-scale growth in military base presence. Using a novel dataset constructed from diverse sources, we track military base locations across Colombian municipalities from 1998 to 2016. Employing an event-study approach, we identify the causal effects of military bases on host communities. Our findings reveal that the presence of military bases significantly increases sexual violence, with a 72% rise in registered cases over the course of 14 years after the introduction of military base. Despite this increase in sexual violence, we find no significant changes in fertility or child support disputes. These results are not driven by changes in population or security conditions. While the data do not allow us to directly assess the role of non-state armed actors, existing reports indicate potential collaboration between the military and paramilitary groups, which could contribute to the observed rise in sexual violence. This study advances the literature on conflict-related sexual violence and the broader consequences of military base presence on local populations.</p>
