**Watch Your Step: The Impact of Landmines on Rural Households During Conflict**
(with [Sakina Shibuya](https://sakinashibuya.org))

<b>Abstract:</b> Antipersonnel landmines, though intended to target combatants, disproportionately impact civilians, disrupting economic activity and altering household decision-making processes. This paper explores how rural households in Colombia adjust their labor decisions and healthcare-seeking behavior in response to nearby landmine events, using detailed spatial data on landmine events combined with longitudinal household survey data. We find that individuals recently exposed to landmines are 16% less likely to work in jobs other than agricultural daily labor but are more likely to hire agricultural workers, primarily substituting their own labor with external workers. Liquidity constraints significantly influence these responses: landowners, who are less likely to face liquidity constraints, reduce non-daily agricultural work without increasing other employment. Conversely, non-landowners, who are more likely to be liquidity constrained, decrease non-agricultural off-farm work while increasing agricultural daily labor. Landmine exposure also deters individuals from seeking formal preventative care. This study enhances our understanding of landmines' nuanced socioeconomic effects.
