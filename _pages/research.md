**Watch Your Step: The Impact of Landmines on Rural Households During Conflict (Job Market Paper)**<br>
(with [Sakina Shibuya](https://sakinashibuya.org))[*draft coming soon*]

<p style="font-size: 85%; width=80%"><b>Abstract:</b> Antipersonnel landmines, though intended to target combatants, disproportionately impact civilians, disrupting economic activity and altering household decision-making processes. This paper explores how rural households in Colombia adjust their labor decisions and healthcare-seeking behavior in response to nearby landmine events, using detailed spatial data on landmine events combined with longitudinal household survey data. We find that individuals recently exposed to landmines are 16% less likely to work in jobs other than agricultural daily labor but are more likely to engage in agricultural daily labor. Exposed households are also 21% more likely to hire agricultural workers, primarily substituting their own labor with external workers. Liquidity constraints significantly influence these responses: landowners, who are less likely to face liquidity constraints, reduce non-daily agricultural work without increasing other employment. Conversely, non-landowners, who are more likely to be liquidity-constrained, decrease non-agricultural off-farm work while increasing agricultural daily labor. Landmine exposure also deters individuals from seeking formal preventative medical care. This study enhances our understanding of landmines’ nuanced socioeconomic effects.</p>


**Effects of Military Bases on Women in Colombia**<br>
(with [Sakina Shibuya](https://sakinashibuya.org))[*draft coming soon*]

<p style="font-size: 85%; width=80%"><b>Abstract:</b> Sexual violence committed by state soldiers are ubiquitous across the world. This paper investigates the impact of military base presence on sexual violence, fertility, and child support disputes in Colombia, a nation with a recent experience of large-scale growth in military base presence. Using a novel dataset constructed from diverse sources, we track military base locations across Colombian municipalities from 1998 to 2016. Employing an event-study approach, we identify the causal effects of military bases on host communities. Our findings reveal that the presence of military bases significantly increases sexual violence, with a 72% rise in registered cases over the course of 14 years after the introduction of military base. Despite this increase in sexual violence, we find no significant changes in fertility or child support disputes. These results are not driven by changes in population or security conditions. While the data do not allow us to directly assess the role of non-state armed actors, existing reports indicate potential collaboration between the military and paramilitary groups, which could contribute to the observed rise in sexual violence. This study advances the literature on conflict-related sexual violence and the broader consequences of military base presence on local populations.</p>
