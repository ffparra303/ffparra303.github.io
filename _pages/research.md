<b>Watch Your Step: The Impact of Landmines on Rural Households During Conflict</b> (with [Sakina Shibuya]({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://sakinashibuya.org/"}}{\fldrslt https://sakinashibuya.org}}))\

<b>Abstract:</b> Antipersonnel landmines, though intended to target combatants, disproportionately impact civilians, disrupting economic activity and altering household decision-making processes. This paper explores how rural households in Colombia adjust their labor decisions and healthcare-seeking behavior in response to nearby events, using detailed spatial data on landmine events combined with longitudinal household survey data. We find that individuals recently exposed to landmines are 16% less likely to work in jobs other than agricultural daily labor but are more likely to engage in agricultural daily labor. Exposed households are also 21% more likely to hire agricultural workers, primarily substituting their own labor with external workers. Liquidity constraints significantly influence these responses: landowners, who are less likely to face liquidity constraints, reduce non-daily agricultural work without increasing other employment. Conversely, non-landowners, who are more likely to be liquidity-constrained, decrease non-agricultural off-farm work while increasing agricultural daily labor. Landmine exposure also deters individuals from seeking formal preventative care. This study enhances our understanding of landmines\'92 nuanced socioeconomic effects.}
