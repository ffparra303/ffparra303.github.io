I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

I am an applied microeconomist with broad research interests in development, labor, and industrial organization. My research focuses on how conflict affects the livelihoods of people living in war zones and the impact of competition in agricultural input markets in East Africa.
