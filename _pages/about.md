I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Watson School of International and Public Affairs at Brown University. I completed my Ph.D. in Agricultural and Applied Economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

I am an applied microeconomist with broad research interests in development economics and political economy. My research focuses on how conflict affects the livelihoods of people living in war zones and the impact of competition in agricultural input markets in East Africa.
